\section{Discussion  and Next Steps}

Aside from research purposes, Brighter the Animation as a short film is more of a passion project rather than something done for networking and submission to film festivals. It is not possible to submit this short film to any festival due to copyright with Paramore, and posting it online is only possible due to Fair Use Policy. In addition, it is estimated to complete postprocessing of this short film in 5 to 6 months, which could have been used for retraining and creation of shorter films for faster feedback loop.\\\\
These are the reasons why I will not be pursuing to complete the postprocessing as it would be more logical to focus on creating newer productions without using any copyrighted material. For the next stage of this research, an actual short film that makes use of original music and dubbing is the main priority. This next stage will be a clearer view on both the research and application aspects, and is also a way to get into the actual anime industry scene for networking and finding like-minded people to join and ultimately create a company that applies this paper's vision.\\\\

In addition, on the more technical side, some possible next steps include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item As discussed in the previous sections, research on training GANs to convert freestyle render to actual anime
        \begin{itemize}
            \item How this would not be completely perfect but can be used as good initial frames ready to be cleaned up by animators
            \item One hurdle for this method is animation of clothes, which may be a separate set of inputs and outputs for the models
        \end{itemize}
    \item Research on more in-depth motion capture models~\cite{everybodyDanceNow} than OpenPose~\cite{openposeArxiv}
    \item Research on PaintsChainer~\cite{paintsChainer} retraining for colour consistency with RNNs
    \item Research feasibility of more direct pipelines~\cite{makeGirlsMoe, fullBodyAnimeGeneration, vid2vid} that convert video directly to anime
    \item Wait for NVIDIA's frame interpolation SDK~\cite{nvidiaNGXTech} and research possibilities~\cite{superSlomo}
\end{enumerate}

The major issue with using research material for application is it will take a lot of time and effort to create datasets that can be used commercially. This is why if funding becomes available for starting a company with this paper's vision, the first phase would most likely be use of the motion capture automation discussed in the previous sections rather than the deep learning libraries. Moreover, automated libraries are prone to becoming cookie-cutter processes that are not production-level, meaning the feasibility of using the library is based on using them as base frames \& automating low-level tasks rather than for actual output and the benefits of applying said base outputs for high quality, production-level output after human post-processing.
