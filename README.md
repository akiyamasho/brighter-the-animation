# Brighter the Animation

This was an 8-month research/short film project that aimed to study 3D to 2D technologies for creating Japanese-style animation (Anime). It was conducted from January to August 2018.

The website can be accessed at https://www.brightertheanimation.com.

### Short Film

The short film is about a budding actress and an animator going through life in their mid-twenties. It is mainly for research purposes so I used an old Paramore song called Brighter.
